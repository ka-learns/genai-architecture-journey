# GenAI Architecture Journey 🚀

This repository documents my 12-week journey from AWS Solutions Architect → AI Solutions Architect.  
It contains hands-on projects, learning notes, and certification prep for roles at companies like Anthropic, NVIDIA, and OpenAI.

## 🗺️ Roadmap (12 Weeks)

- **Week 1–3:** AI/ML foundations (Coursera GenAI with LLMs + Hugging Face basics)  
- **Week 4:** NVIDIA NCA-GENL certification + Project 1 (LLM Chatbot)  
- **Week 5–7:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) + Project 2 (Knowledge Assistant)  
- **Week 8–9:** AI Infrastructure (NVIDIA Triton, TensorRT, Kubernetes) + Project 3 (Scalable GPU Inference Pipeline)  
- **Week 10–12:** NVIDIA NCP-AII prep + portfolio polish + application-ready
